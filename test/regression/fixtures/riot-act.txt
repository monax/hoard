Full text of the Riot Act (c. 1714-1715)


Typed in this February 8, 2002 by Jonathan Walther. The source was cap
V, volume XIII, pages 142-146 of the "Statutes At Large" series,
printed in the year 1764. Also indexed as "Anno primo GEORGEII I. Stat.
2. C. 5." Many sources on the Internet claim the Riot Act was passed in
1715; according to Statutes At Large it was passed in 1714. The
confusion may be caused by the fact that the Act took _effect_ in
August of 1715. This is, of course, the famous Riot Act that gave rise
to the expression _"Read them the Riot Act!_".



CAP. V.

An act for preventing tumults and riotous assemblies, and for the more
speedy and effectual punishing the rioters.


I.

Whereas of late many rebellious riots and tumults have been in divers
parts of this kingdom, to the disturbance of the publick peace, and the
endangering of his Majesty's person and government, and the same are
yet continued and fomented by persons disaffected to his Majesty,
presuming so to do, for that the punishments provided by the laws now
in being are not adequate to such heinous offences; and by such rioters
his Majesty and his administration have been most maliciously and
falsly traduced, with an intent to raise divisions, and to alienate the
affections of the people from his Majesty therefore for the preventing
and suppressing of such riots and tumults, and for the more speedy and
effectual punishing the offenders therein; be it enacted by the King's
most excellent majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the lords
spiritual and temporal and of the commons, in this present parliament
assembled, and by the authority of the same, That if any persons to the
number of twelve or more, being unlawfully, riotously, and tumultuously
assembled together, to the disturbance of the publick peace, at any
time after the last day of _July_ in the year of our Lord one thousand
seven hundred and fifteen, and being required or commanded by any one
or more justice or justices of the peace, or by the sheriff of the
county, or his under-sheriff, or by the mayor, bailiff or bailiffs, or
other head-officer, or justice of the peace of any city or town
corporate, where such assembly shall be, by proclamation to be made in
the King's name, in the form herin after directed, to disperse
themselves, and peaceably to depart to their habitations, or to their
lawful business, shall, to the number of twelve or more
(notwithstanding such proclamation made) unlawfully, riotously, and
tumultuously remain or continue together by the space of one hour after
such command or request made by proclamation, that then such continuing
together to the number of twelve or more, after such command or request
made by proclamation, shall be adjudged felony without benefit of
clergy, and the offenders therein shall be adjudged felons, and shall
suffer death as in a case of felony without benefit of clergy.



II.

And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That the order
and form of the proclamation that shall be made by the authority of
this act, shall be as hereafter followeth (that is to say) the justice
of the peace, or other person authorized by this act to make the said
proclamation shall, among the said rioters, or as near to them as he
can safely come, with a loud voice command, or cause to be commanded
silence to be, while proclamation is making, and after that, shall
openly and with loud voice make or cause to be made proclamation in
these words, or like in effect:


  Our sovereign Lord the King chargeth and commandeth all
  persons, being assembled, immediately to disperse themselves,
  and peaceably to depart to their habitations, or to their
  lawful business, upon the pains contained in the act made
  in the first year of King George, for preventing tumults
  and riotous assemblies. God save the King.


And every such justice and justices of the peace, sheriff,
under-sheriff, mayor, bailiff, and other head-officer aforesaid, within
the limits of their respective jurisdictions, are hereby authorized,
impowered and required, on notice or knowledge of any such unlawful,
riotous and tumultuous assembly, to resort to the place where such
unlawful, riotous, and tumultuous assemblies shall be, of persons to
the number of twelve or more, and there to make or cause to be made
proclamation in manner aforesaid.



III.

And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if such
persons so unlawfully, riotously, and tumultuously assembled, or twelve
or more of them, after proclamation made in manner aforesaid, shall
continue together and not disperse themselves within one hour, That
then it shall and may be lawful to and for every justice of the peace,
sheriff, or under-sheriff of the county where such assembly shall be,
and also to and for every high or petty constable, and other
peace-officer within such county, and also to and for every mayor,
justice of the peace, sheriff, bailiff, and other head-officer, high or
petty constable, and other peace-officer of any city or town corporate
where such assembly shall be, and to and for such other person and
persons as shall be commanded to be assisting unto any such justice of
the peace, sheriff or under-sheriff, mayor, bailiff, or other
head-officer aforesaid (who are hereby authorized and impowered to
command all his Majesty's subjects of age and ability to be assisting
to them therein) to seize and apprehend, and they are hereby required
to seize and apprehend such persons so unlawfully, riotously and
tumultuously continuing together after proclamation made, as aforesaid,
and forthwith to carry the persons so apprehended before one or more of
his Majesty's justices of the peace of the county or place where such
persons shall be so apprehended, in order to their being proceeded
against for such their offences according to law; and that if the
persons so unlawfully, riotously and tumultuously assembled, or any of
them, shall happen to be killed, maimed or hurt, in the dispersing,
seizing or apprehending, or endeavouring to disperse, seize or
apprehend them, that then every such justice of the peace, sheriff,
under-sheriff, mayor, bailiff, head-officer, high or petty constable,
or other peace-officer, and all and singular persons, being aiding and
assisting to them, or any of them, shall be free, discharged and
indemnified, as well against the King's Majesty, his heirs and
successors, as against all and every other person and persons, of, for,
or concerning the killing, maiming, or hurting of any such person or
persons so unlawfully, riotously and tumultuously assembled, that shall
happen to be so killed, maimed or hurt, as aforesaid.



IV.

And be it further enacted by the authority aforesaid, That if any
persons unlawfully, riotously and tumultuously assembled together, to
the disturbance of the publick peace, shall unlawfully, and with force
demolish or pull down, or begin to demolish or pull down any church or
chapel, or any building for religious worship certified and registred

their Majesty's protestant subjects dissenting from the church of_
England _from the penalties of certain laws_, or any dwelling-house,
barn, stable, or other out-house, that then every such demolishing, or

adjudged felons, and shall suffer death as in case of felony, without
benefit of clergy.

proclamation, as aforesaid, shall be adjudged felony without benefit of
clergy, and the offenders therein shall be adjudged felons, and shall
suffer death as in case of felony, without benefit of clergy; and that
also every such person or persons so being unlawfully, riotously and

such church, chapel, building for religious worship, dwelling-house,
barn, stable, or out-house, shall be out of any city or town, that is

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
